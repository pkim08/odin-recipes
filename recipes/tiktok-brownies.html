    <h1>TikTok Brownies</h1>
    <img src="../images/brownies.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Anyway, here's the recipe for the simple brownies you saw in the TikTok comments.</p>
    <h2>Indredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, plus additional for greasing pan</li>
        <li>⅓ cup cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Coat an 8x8-inch metal baking dish with butter.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. 
            Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes. 
            Whisk in cocoa powder, sugar, and vanilla extract. 
            Stir in eggs, 1 at a time until incorporated. 
            Add flour and stir until just combined. 
            Scrape mixture into the prepared pan and smooth the top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for at least 45 minutes before cutting.</li>
    </ol>
  
    <h2>TikTok Chef's Notes:</h2>
    <p>There isn't salt in the original TikTok "recipe," but we suggest adding ¼ teaspoon kosher salt when you stir in the cocoa powder.
    <br>Use the paper butter wrapper to coat the pan! Usually there's a bit of butter stuck to it that's perfect for this purpose!</p>
